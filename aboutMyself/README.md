# aboutMyself

My name is Alexandr. I have master degree in telecommunication. Currently working as QA engineer. Lately, I have been involved in deployment process, that is how I got interested in DevOps field.
My main goal for near future to kick-start my DevOps career.

## Why I am interested in the course

+ I was looking for a kind of "mentor" guidance, most of my knowledge are self learned. Get aligned with industry standards is always a good idea. 
+ Also, I wanted to compare myself with others, just to better understand my level of competence.
+ Understand my weak spots, so I can tighten them up.

These are my general expectations, they might be changed/modified. 

## What I expect from the course

+ Get my hands dirty with DevOps tooling.
+ Receive feedback about tasks I will resolve along this course.
+ Change my professional occupation from QA to DevOps.

These are my general expectations, they might be changed/modified.
